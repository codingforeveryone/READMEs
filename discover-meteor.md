### What is Meteor.js?
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript.

"Meteor.js is a cohesive development platform, a collection of libraries and packages that are bound together in a tidy way to make web development easier". [Josh Owens](http://joshowens.me/what-is-meteor-js/)

### Create a Project

After having installed Meteor, let's create a project, in your terminal type:
```bash
$ meteor create the-name-of-your-app
```

Now you can run your app locally:
```bash
$ cd the-name-of-your-app
$ meteor
```
