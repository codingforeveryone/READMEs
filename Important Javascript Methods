This article entails a listing of all JavaScript methods alphabetically.

1.abs: The Math.abs() function returns the absolute value of a number.
2.bind: The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value,
with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
3.ceil: The Math.ceil() function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.
4.charAt: The charAt() method returns the specified character from a string.
5.concat: The concat() method combines the text of one or more strings and returns a new string.
6.every: The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
7.fill: The fill() method fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value.
8.filter: The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
9.find: The find() method returns a value in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function.
Otherwise undefined is returned.
10.findIndex: The findIndex() method returns an index in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function.
Otherwise -1 is returned.
11.getDate: The getDate() method returns the day of the month for the specified date according to local time.
12.has: The has() method returns a boolean indicating whether an element with the specified key exists or not.
13.includes: The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.
14.indexOf: The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
15.isNaN: The Number.isNaN() method determines whether the passed value is NaN. It is a more robust version of the original, 
global isNaN().
16.join: The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.
17.lastIndexOf: The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not
present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.
18.log10: The Math.log10() function returns the base 10 logarithm of a number, that is
19.map: The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
20.max: The Math.max() function returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
21.parseInt: The Number.parseInt() method parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base.
22.pow: The Math.pow() function returns the base to the exponent power, that is, baseexponent.
23.random: The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1) that is, from 0 (inclusive)
up to but not including 1 (exclusive), which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to
the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.
24.reduce: The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it
to a single value.
25.repeat: The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which
it was called, concatenated together.
26.slice: The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.
27.splice: The splice() method changes the content of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
28.test: The test() method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false.
