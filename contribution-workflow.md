# Contribution Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the workflow and steps to go through when proposing new changes to the READMEs repository. The workflow should be followed when making changes to improve current READMEs as well as when adding new READMEs.
At first sight the process might seem complicated, but it is a great exercise to practise contributing to future programming projects and ensures that all added changes are checked.

If you have any questions or are stuck somewhere please don't hesitate to ask in the README Gitter channel: [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs](https://badges.gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs.svg)](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

##The Feature Branch Workflow

The process used is called [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The basic concept of this workflow is that every change is treated as a new "feature" and made on a branch dedicated to that change.
Once the change is ready a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is raised. This pull request will be checked by another person and then merged into the master branch.
After merging, the branch is deleted.


While you could do all your editing and branch creation using the GitHib online interface, it is easier in the long run to keep a copy of the repository on your local machine, and work on it there. This entails setting up Git and learning to use the command line interface.

##Setting up a local repository

Before working with the READMEs repository we should install Git and clone the repository to our local directory. Refer to [Git Basics]((http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/git-basics.html#installing-git-on-mac)) for instructions on how to install Git (and glance over the [cheat sheet](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/git-basics.html#cheat-sheet) while you're there).
Be aware that most beginners' guides to setting up Git out on the web assume that you will be making contributions via a fork. **In this workflow though we don't use forks (remote copies of the repository) but simply branches.**

Setting up Git without a fork is simpler. All you need to do is clone the remote repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs.git
```

You now have a local copy of the repository, but you are not quite ready to make changes to it. You need to ensure it is up to date. Navigate to your local repository:

```bash
$ cd READMEs
```

Then tell Git to pull any changes on the master branch of origin (the default name for the remote repository) into your local repository:

```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

Now make your change! In the next section we will go through the steps necessary to get your local change merged into the main repository, and how to execute them through the command line.

##Steps to go through for each change

There are 4 main steps to go through for a new change to be implemented. The first 3 steps are done by the person who proposes the change, while the fourth step has to be done by a different person to ensure quality.

1. Create a new branch
2. Stage, commit & push changes to the branch
4. Create and assign a pull request
5. Review & merge the changes

###1. Create a new branch

The first step is to create a new branch for the proposed change. Before you create the branch you should make sure your master is up-to-date by pulling all previous changes with `git pull`.

To create a new branch and switch to the branch at the same time, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ git checkout -b <name of the branch>
```

This is equivalent to first creating the branch and then switching to it with the following two commands:

```bash
$ git branch <name of the branch>
$ git checkout <name of the branch>
```

After creating and switching to the branch locally, you should push the branch to GitHub and set it as the default upstream branch:

```bash
$ git push -u origin <name of the branch>
```

More details on creating and managing branches can be found in the following [documentation](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches).

So how should you name your branch? Here's where the naming convention comes in.

####Naming convention for new branches

In order to clearly identify what the branch is used for, the branch should be named according to the following naming convention.

**"file name"/"type of change"/"short summary of change"**

Examples for possible branch names:
* README/add/intro-added
* ES6/correct/typos
* hoisting/enhance/structure-changed
* contribution-workflow/new

This kind of naming convention does not only help to see what branches are used for. It also impacts the review process because a simple typo correction can be approved and merged more quickly than a larger change.

_NOTE: This naming convention makes sense for this repository because changes should be made to each README file on separate branches. For other projects you might want to choose different naming conventions._

###2. Stage, commit & push the changes to the branch

These steps add your local changes to the branch. Here the basic terminal commands for the Mac command line are outlined.

More details on these commands can be found in the [Git Basics Tutorial](http://codingforeveryone.foundersandcoders.org/programmer-skills/git-basics.html) and the [official Github help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-from-the-command-line/).

Staging changes to the file:

```bash
$ git add <name of the file>
```
_NOTE: If you are editing a file in one of "READMEs" subdirectories (e.g. "Javascript", "codewars", etc), include the file path in <name of the file\>, in the above step._

Commiting the staged changes:

```bash
$ git commit -m "summary of changes made"
```

Pushing the commited stages on the branch to the remote repository:

```bash
$ git push
```

For `git push` to correctly work, the default upstream branch has to be set correctly already. Otherwise you have to use the following command once in order to set the upstream branch.

```bash
git push -u origin <name of the branch>
```

###3. Create pull request to master

A [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is a request to transfer the changes from your branch to master. To issue the pull request we recommend using the GitHub website.

On the repository you will go through the following steps to issue your pull request:

1. Switch to your branch via the drop-down menu on the top left.
2. Click on "New pull request"
3. Name and assign your pull request
4. Click on "Create pull request"

This is quite straightforward. You can see the steps in more detail on [Github help](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Note: If you find you have additional commits to push to the same file after completing the above steps, you may replicate part of the steps above and push additional commits to the existing pull request.
To do so, start by setting the default upstream branch as before, then simply follow Step 2 again to stage, commit, and push the ADDITIONAL changes. If done correctly, the additional commits should be visible within your existing pull request. 

#### Assign the pull request

If possible, always assign your pull request to a specific person. That makes sure someone gets notified to look at it.
The assigned person should either be the original creator of the README file or someone who recently contributed a lot. 
To check who you should assign your request to, go back to the original file in the repository. To the right side, under "Contributors" you will find the "Blame" button. This reveals the change list, sorted by date in descending order and with corresponding usernames.

To assign your pull request to an individual, go back to the page for your specific pull request and on the right side of the page you will see "Assignee" next to a grey gear symbol. Click the gear, and search for the user from the previous step.

For completely new README files you created, you don't have to assign anyone. Instead just post the link in the [README Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/READMEs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge).
Then anyone available can check and merge your new README.

###4. Review & merge the changes to master

**Important:** This is not done by the same person who proposed the change.

The last step for the change to be implemented is the review and merging of the pull request to master.
Here we will differentiate between different **types of changes** indicated by the **second part of the branch name**.

**For significant changes** such as the adding new paragraphs (_type: add_) or structural changes (_type: enhance_) the assigned person (mostly the creator) should check and merge the pull request. Other people can also check it and provide their comments but shouldn't merge it immediately. Only if the assigned person doesn't react to the pull request within at least 3 days, then other contributors are also allowed to check and merge it.

**For smaller changes** such as pure corrections of typos (_type: correct_) anyone can check and merge the pull request.

After merging the pull request the branch is not needed any more and should be deleted by the person who merged it. This can be done directly in the pull request view or in the terminal with the following command.

```bash
git branch -D <name of the branch>
```
