# CSS Centering

Centering with css is a task that a front end developer has to perform frequently. There are many ways to center DOM elements and it will depend on many factors as DOM elements to be centered, parent-children structure, developer preferences, and other restrictions. Below I will summarize some of the most useful ways I have found.

When centering, we create a relationship between two elements, usually parent-children, so most of the centering techniques will make reference to styling both parent and children element.

## Using text-align: center
*This technique centers only horizontally*  
To align an element with the css attribute `text-align`, it must behave as an *inline* element. There are many elements that behave as *inline* by default, but you can style it as `inline-block` (or any other *inline*) and you can get the same results. In case you have other requirements that prevent the element to behave as *inline*, then you should go for another technique.

The HTML:
```HTML
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="child">
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

The CSS code:
```CSS
.parent {
  text-align: center
}

.child {
  display: inline-block
}
```

Notice that the element centered is the one with the class `child`, and the parent is the one with the attribute `text-align`.

## Using margin: auto
*This technique centers only horizontally*  
To use this technique, we are going to need the element to behave as *block*. This one is one of the simplest, as you just need to give the value of `auto` to the margins of each side.

The HTML:
```HTML
<body>
  <div class="centered">
  </div>
</body>
```

The CSS code:
```CSS
.centered {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

If you don't have any restriction on vertical margins, you can use the margin shorthand:
```CSS
.centered {
  margin: auto
}
```

## Using absolute positioning
You can use this technique whenever your design fulfills two requisites:
  * You know the size of the element. In case you don't know the size of your element, there are alternatives that can still suit you.
  * You can set the element position as `absolute`, and the parent's position as `relative`. If you cannot, you could probably nest your element in an outer `<div>` and use this technique with that div as the parent.

The HTML:
```HTML
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="centered">
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

For the code, let's suppose that the known width is `300px`, and the known height is `200px`. The CSS code:
```CSS
.parent {
  position: relative
}

.centered {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  margin-left: -150px;
  margin-top: -100px
}
```
[*Play with this code on JSFiddle*](https://jsfiddle.net/dangonrei/qh6y7vqo/)

**Explanation:**
  * `position: absolute` means you're able to set the position of the element freely, using the attributes top, left, right and bottom.
  * `left: 50%` sets the left border of the element exactly at a distance of **50% of its parent's width**. That is, the left border of the element gets placed just in the middle of its parent, horizontally.
  * `top: 50%` add the same logic as `left: 50%`, but this time vertically.
  * `margin-left: -150px` puts a *negative margin* to the element as big as **half of its width**. This forces the element to be placed in the center of its parent horizontally.
  * `margin-top: -100px` has the same purpose of `margin-left`, but this time using **half of its height**, placing it vertically in the center of its parent.

## Using translate
To use this technique you should be able to set the element position as `absolute`, and the parents position as `relative`. If you cannot, you could probably nest your element in an outer `<div>` and use this technique with that div as the parent.

:warning:  *Note on `transform` property*: **the transform property allows for modifying an elements position, size and rotation in place. Though versatile, it is not widely adopted by many modern browsers by default, and requires additional prefixed declarations to extend support. The code shown below is not prefixed in order to keep the focus on centering HTML elements. If you want to expand your knowledge about prefixes, you can check the [resources](#resources).** |

The HTML:
```HTML
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="centered">
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

The CSS code:
```CSS
.parent {
  position: relative
}

.centered {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
}
```
[*Play with this code on JSFiddle*](https://jsfiddle.net/dangonrei/a3zfkat0/)

**Explanation:** The attributes `position`, `left` and `top` are used with the same purpose as in [absolute positioning](#using-absolute-positioning). The `transform` attribute defined in the code, translates both vertical and horizontally the element by 50%. The difference is that, inside `transform`, the dimensions given in percentages **are relatives to the element dimensions**, and not to the parents. Therefore, you are just moving to the left by half of the width and to the top by half of the height.

## Using flexbox
To use this technique, the parent of the centered element should behave as a *flexbox*. To do so, you should just be able to set the parent display as `flex` or `inline-flex`, depending on your design.  
**Note** that using a *flexbox* may produce unexpected results if you don't understand how they work.

:warning:  *Note on Flexbox*: **Flexbox is also not widely adopted, therefore appropriate prefixed declarations should be written. Check the [resources](#resources) for further information.** |

The HTML:
```HTML
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    <div class="centered">
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

The CSS code:
```CSS
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
[*Play with this code on JSFiddle*](https://jsfiddle.net/dangonrei/abg85wa8/)

**Explanation:**
  * `display: flex` makes the parent behave as a flexbox, and allows you to use the following attributes.
  * `justify-content: center` set the content of the *flexbox* centered in the *main-axis*. By default the `flex-direction` is set to `row`, so you should expect it to center in width by default.
  * `align-items: center` set the content centered in the *cross axis*, so by default, you should expect it to center vertically its content.

The *flexbox* is a very powerful tool, that can be extremely helpful when used correctly. On the other hand, using it without having a basic knowledge of its behavior can lead to results difficult to understand. I strongly recommend learning the basics before using them.
