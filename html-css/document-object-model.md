# A primer on Document Object Model (DOM)

It all starts when you visit a webpage, there are a few things going on in the background whenever a web page is displayed in the browser. 

1. When you visit a URL, the browser will fetch the HTML file from the destination along with the assets needed (i.e css, js, images etc).

2. The browser will then parse the HTML file and produce a representation, or a structure of that file. 

3. It then goes to a process where the browser renders the visual attributes for each section of this structure and give them a size and coordinate.

4. With the model of the HTML file created, the browser then paints it in the display pixel by pixel.

5. This model that we just described, is the DOM (aka Document Object Model).

## How does the DOM look like

When the DOM is created, it is represented by a [Tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure). 

Here's an example, the following HTML syntax

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
     <head>
     	<title>Welcome</title>
     </head>
     <body>
     	<h1>This is my homepage</h1>
        <p>I hope you like it</p>
     </body>
</html>
```

will produce the following tree structure, and each page element is represented by a tree node (**Note**: This is a simplification of what the actual tree structure is):

![DOM tree structure](/images/dom/dom-tree-small.png)

You can also visually see the DOM using the browser's developer tool. Simply bring up a browser (eg Google Chrome or Firefox) and press ```Cmd + Opt + I``` on Mac or ```Ctrl + shift + I``` on Windows.

## The DOM is also referred to as an API

An application programming interface [(API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) is simply just a means for one computer program to communicate with another computer program. In this context, the DOM API allows the interaction and manipulation of the html document in the browser through Javascript code.

## Interacting with the DOM

There are several ways to interact with the DOM, they are inclusive of but not limited to:

##### 1. Traverse the DOM tree structure

If you go over to the console in the browser development tool, and type in ```document```, you can see its immediate child nodes being logged. The ```document``` node sits right at the top of the tree (aka the root node). 

![DOM document](/images/dom/document.png)


Every parent node has a ```childNodes``` method that can be called to retrieve its child nodes in an array.


![DOM document's child node](/images/dom/document-childnode.png)


and you can traverse further into the tree structure


![DOM document's grand child node](/images/dom/document-child-child.png)


just as a parent node has a ```childNodes``` method, the child nodes themselves have a ```parentNode``` method to find its parent, although they will have only one.

##### 2. Finding a specific sub-section of web page

We can reach any node on the page by means of ```childNodes``` and ```parentNode```, but we can already tell that doing so can be very repetitive. Fortunately the DOM allows us to find a specific node of the page more easily.

Now update the HTML syntax to the following:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
     <head>
     	<title>Welcome</title>
     </head>
     <body>
     	<h1 id="blue">This is my homepage</h1>
        <p class="yellow">I hope you like it</p>
     </body>
</html>
```

**Find node by Id**: Just as the title imply we can find a node on the page using ```document.getElementById```

![Get by ID](/images/dom/get-by-id.png)

**Find node by Class name**: You can also find a node on the page using ```document.getElementsByClassName```

![Get by class name](/images/dom/get-by-classname.png)

**Find node by html tag (i.e body, head, h1, p etc)**: Try and find the node by ```document.getElementsByTagName```

![Get by tag](/images/dom/get-by-tag.png)

Of course, there are several other ways in which you can find nodes on the page, feel free to explore them:

![Get options](/images/dom/get-option.png)

##### 3. Manipulating the DOM elements

While we can certainly inspect the DOM elements and its structure, we can also change it. Below we are changing the text in the ```<h1>``` from "This is my homepage" to "This is David's homepage" using ```element.innerText```.

![Before node manipulation](/images/dom/manipulate-before.png)

![After node manipulation](/images/dom/manipulate-after.png)

Often times the manipulation of the DOM is done using Javascript. We can simply update our HTML syntax again to show an example:


```
<!doctype html>
<html>
     <head>
     	<title>Welcome</title>
     </head>
     <body>
     	<h1 id="blue">This is my homepage</h1>
        <p class="yellow">I hope you like it</p>
         <script>
        	var a = document.getElementById('blue');
        	a.innerText = "This is her homepage";
        </script>
     </body>
</html>
```

In the code above we just added some simple Javascript to change the text in the ```<h1>```

Here's the output from the console:

![Her homepage](/images/dom/her-homepage.png)

You can see that even though the ```<h1>``` text was defined "This is my homepage" originally, it was later modified to "This is her homepage" by the javascript code.

## Going further with jQuery

jQuery is a javascript library that allows us to manipulate the DOM. According to Wikipedia:  
>"jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document"

And indeed, it makes navigating in the DOM easy, using the power of Javascript.

#### 1. Including jQuery in your project

The simplest way to use jQuery is to add it from the CDN([Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network));

`<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>` 

#### 2. jQuery syntax and starting point

jQuery syntax is made to be easy to understand if you know javascript basics already. It starts with a `$` function, and then the object you want to call.

You'll usually want to start your jQuery script with this function:

``` 
$(document).ready(function(){
       Your code here 
}); 
```

* `$(document)`selects the `document` object
* `.ready` method tells the browser to only execute your function (your code) when the DOM is ready. Here it takes a function as its argument.
* Your code will go inside the function: `function(){YOUR CODE}` 

#### 3. Chaining

With jQuery, you can write cascading commands/methods:

`$("div.test").add("p.quote").addClass("blue").slideDown("slow");`

This is called chaining: The perfect way to achieve DRY awesomeness ! ;)

#### 4. More about jQuery 

These are the basics about how jQuery can manipulate the DOM. To learn more about it, you can go to the [learn section](http://learn.jquery.com/) of jQuery.com or you can do the [jQuery course on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapsejQuery).


## Other example uses cases of the DOM

- [Adding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) or [removing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) HTML elements on the web page
- Creating [events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkZbTXbBwM&index=4&list=PL18600E7CA651B16B) listener, i.e do something on the web page when people click, hover or type something.
- Create [animation](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp)
- Do something once a web page is [loaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload)
- [Change the attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) of the HTML elements
- [Manipulate text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)
- [Changing the visual outlook](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp)or the style (eg. color) of the page document

## Summary

- The DOM is a model created by the browser to represent the web page document being visited.
- This model can be viewed, interacted with, and be manipulated.
- The DOM is also an API where HTML & Javascript can be used to change its visible content.
- The DOM is created with a tree structure, where each node in the tree has a ```childNodes``` and ```parentNode``` method, to depict the relationship between the elements on the page document.
