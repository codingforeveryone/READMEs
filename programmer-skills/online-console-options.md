# Online console options

###Introduction:

This README tutorial is an introduction to your online console and debugging options when starting out as a software developer.

Code compilers and consoles are a great tool for creating small pieces of code and debugging purposes. 
<br>These tools are particularly useful when solving Codewars katas.

There are many options to suit your coding requirements. Here are some popular suggestions with pros and cons for each. 

There are 3 key points to take into consideration when choosing a platform to use:

  1. What coding languages do they support?
  2. Do they simply help debug through syntax checking or can you run code and check the result in a console?
  3. Do you have to set up an account to use them?

### Console and debugging tools:

  2. You can run code in the console and there is a built in syntax checker too.<br>
  3. You can use this tool without an account and can save multiple sets of code with an account<br>

<b>Pros:</b> The best tool for creating functions and testing them in a console. Free service with great aims to democratize coding and make it accessible.<br>
<b>Cons:</b> You have to create an account to retrieve saved code.

  3. 100% functionality can be used without an account. <br>

<b>Pros:</b> Very intuitive to use. Best tool for simple debugging purposes<br>
<b>Cons:</b> No console output makes the tool limited in its use. You can't save code.<br>
