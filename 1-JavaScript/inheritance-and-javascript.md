#Inheritance and JavaScript

Most modern object oriented programming (OOP) languages support the concept of inheritance.  Think of this as a child inheriting the functionality of its parent, where the child can add its own specifics.  This is done with the concept of classes.  Classes maybe thought of as blueprints.    


So for example in C#, C++ or Java we may have a Vehicle class, parent blueprint, which will have steering wheel, engine and wheels.  This Vehicle can be specified further with the following classes of Car and Lorry, child blueprints, which can be specified further and so on.  The important thing is that Car and Lorry both inherit from the Vehicle class.

Another way to look at this is that Car “_is A_” Vehicle and Hatchback “_is A_” Car.  Inheritance of a class from a parent class exemplifies the Is A relationship.  This is also known as classical Inheritance.

However JavaScript **DOES NOT SUPPORT** classical inheritance, it has no concept of classes.  This is very important especially if you have learned another class-based language.  JavaScript is Class-Free Object Oriented Language.  It uses prototypal inheritance, which is where an object inherits from another object.  So objects are based on other objects. 

This is done with the prototype property.  A prototype may be thought of as an object, from which other objects inherit properties. This may inherit from another object, effectively this is a chain of objects. Therefore object properties, which are defined using the prototype object, are inherited by all instances, which reference it.  This can be a bit confusing so it may be demonstrated as follows.

An object and its property

In code it can be accessed by `obj.prop1`  

All objects in JavaScript have a prototype property, also an object. This prototype can also have a property, and this prototype is a reference to another object. This can be shown in the example below.

Then if we call `obj.prop2`  
We are actually calling the prototype property _prop2_.  It looks like _prop2_ is on the _obj_, however is actually on _proto{}_

Now the prototype may also point to another prototype in turn pointing to another prototype, forming a prototype chain.

Now in this example calling `obj.prop3`  
Will actually call the property from _proto2{}_.  We are calling down the prototype chain.  We are seeing where we have access to property amongst a sequence of objects.

We can also have another object referencing _proto{}_, _obj2_.

Now if we call `obj2.prop1`  
then `obj.prop1` is accessing the same property.  There are effectively sharing the same property, not directly but via the prototype chain.

In code terms here is an example 

`var person = {`  
		`firstName: ‘Default’,`  
		`lastName: ‘Default’,`  
		`getFullName: function(){`  
			`return this.firstName + ‘ ‘ + this.lastName;`
	`}`
	
`}`

`//Now another object called ben`

`var ben = {`  
	`firstName: ‘Ben’,`  
	`lastName: ‘Smith’,`  
`}`

`//This below is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used`
`//Can be done in most modern browsers.`  

`//We are setting the prototype of the ben object to the person object`
`ben.__proto__.person;`

`//so ben now inherits from person,`   
`//if we try to access a property or method on ben which does not exist it will go to person.`

`//So now execute`
`console.log(ben.getFullName()); //will return Ben Smith`
`console.log(ben.firstName); //will return Ben NOT Default`

`//Create a new object will only have a first name`
`var colin = {`  
	`firstName: ‘Colin’  `  
`}`

`colin.__proto__.person;`

`console.log(colin.getFullName()); //will return Colin Default`

The above was for example purposes only to illustrate the point.  So to conclude, **Prototypal Inheritance happens when an objects prototype attribute points to another object to inherit it’s attributes and methods.**

There are some very good examples online. Below is a brief list of a few of them:
