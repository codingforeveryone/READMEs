## Recursive Functions

A recursive function is a function that, at some point during it's execution, calls itself. This type of function can be very useful for iterating over data where the total number of elements/objects is not readily apparent, such as in a linked list; or branching is required to access all elements, as in an array whose elements may be arrays which may contain further arrays as elements.

#### Anatomy of a Recursive function

A recursive function will typically first check if a condition is satisfied. This condition is called the **base case**. If the condition is met, the function will return a value or perform some other task. If the condition is not met, the function will return a call to itself with **modified** arguments. This cycle will continue until the condition is met, returning any target value back through the stack to the initial call. 

##### Example 1
```javascript
function searchList(list, named){
  if (list==null){return 'Not Found'};
  return list.name == named ? list.status : searchList(list.next, named)
}

var sunnyVale = {name: 'Ricky',
status: 'Resident',
next: {name: 'Bubbles',
status: 'Resident',
next:{name: 'Julian',
status: 'Resident',
next:{name: 'Lahey',
status: 'Park Supervisor',
next: {name: 'Randy',
status: 'Assistant Park Supervisor',
next: null}}}}};

searchList(sunnyVale, 'Lahey'); //returns 'Park Supervisor'
searchList(sunnyVale, 'Randy'); //returns 'Assistant Park Supervisor'
searchList(sunnyVale, 'Julian'); //returns 'Resident'
searchList(sunnyVale, 'Bubbs'); //returns 'Not Found'
```
In example above, the function ```searchList``` takes 2 arguments, a linked list called ```list```; and a string called ```named```. ```searchList``` first checks if ```list``` is null (which would mean we have come to the end of the list) and returns ```'Not Found'``` if so. The function then checks if the list property ```name``` equals the variable ```named``` we are looking for. If ```list.name``` matches ```named```, it is returned. If not, ```searchList``` calls itself with ```list.next``` as the list to check. This continues like a loop until the right ```name``` is found, or the list ends.

##### Example 2
```javascript
function sum(num, add){
  if (add===0){return num}
  else {
    num += 1;
    return sum(num, add-1)
  }
}
sum(9,10); //returns 19
```
In this example, function ```sum``` adds two numbers. It does this by adding 1 to ```num``` and returning a call to ```sum``` with the argument ```add``` decremented by 1. When ```add``` is 0, ```num``` (having been incremented by 1 ```add``` number of times) is returned.


##### Example 3
```javascript
function factorial (n){
  if (n==0 || n==1){
    return 1;
  }
  return factorial(n-1)*n;
}
factorial(2) // return 2
```
A factorial number is defined as follow: ![factorial](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/9/939c013423574cad70f33eaa7dd68f0c.png)  
In this example the base case is n = 1. n = 0 is added as alternative to take into account the value zero as input.  
When the function is invoked, for example with the value 2 as input, one instance of the the function is added to the execution stack. Since n is not equal to the base case, the function call itself again, this time with the input value of n-1, which is one. The first created instance of the function remains in the execution stack as it waits the second instance to return a value. In the second instance of the function the base case is met, and one is returned to the first instance. The value is multiplied to the value of n inside the first instance, so 1*2, and then return. The result as expected is 2.

This is a classic example used for recursion, as there is a significant advantage in calculating a factorial in this way, in terms of simplicity of code. Try to solve the same problem using a for loop to see for yourself.

##### Example 4 - The Fibonacci Sequence

A common problem found in many Codewars kata is how to generate the fibonacci sequence. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1 and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

The first method we’re going to look at is by looping since it is often easier for people to wrap their head around.

```javascript
var looping = function(n) {
    var a = 0, b = 1, f = 1;
    for(var i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        f = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = f;
    }
    return f;
};
```

We know that Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two sequence numbers which is why we are starting our loop at index two, which is really the third value since our index starts at zero.  The first two numbers in our sequence are zero and one.  The goal is to find the Fibonacci number at a certain sequence index, which in this example is fifteen.

Every loop iteration we are summing the previous two sequence values, then pushing our values up in a sense.  By this I mean that a is dropped off and replaced with b and b is replaced with the current index value of the sequence, being our new sum.  When our loop has reached our desired fifteen index, we can return whatever the new sum value is.

Now let’s take a look at the recursive version of this.

```javascript
var recursive = function(n) {
    if(n <= 2) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return recursive(n - 1) + recursive(n - 2);
    }
};
```
Recursion can be a little tricky to wrap your head around.  In the above code, we are going to plan on receiving the sequence value at index five because anything larger is going to be rough for me to type out.  You can break this down like the following:

```
recursive(4) + recursive(3)
(recursive(3) + recursive(2)) + (recursive(2) + recursive(1))
((recursive(2) + recursive(1)) + 1) + (1 + 1)
((1 + 1) + 1) + (1 + 1)
5
```
You can see above that on every line it is one further iteration through the recursive process.  Based on our function logic, as soon as n <= 2 then we just return a value of one.  At the furthest breakdown, our sum turns into five which is the Fibonacci number at index five.

#### Drawbacks
Recursive functions have two main drawbacks. One is that repeatedly calling a function is less efficient when a standard ```for``` or ```while``` loop will do the job. The other is that each recursive call adds another function to the stack, consuming more and more memory each time. Calling ```sum``` from Example 2 like this: ```sum(9,100000);``` would result in a 'Range' or 'Too much recursion' error as the stack would overflow.
